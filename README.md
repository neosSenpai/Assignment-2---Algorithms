# Assignment 3 - Algorithms 

## Question #1 - Lecture 8
Order the following functions by asymptotic growth rate and explain your answer:
* 4n log n + 2n
* 210
* 2 log n
* 3n + 100 log n
* 4n
* 2n
* n2 + 10 n
* n3
* n log n
## Question #2 - Lecture 9:
Draw the recursion trace (refer to an example in Figure 5.1) for the execution of method reverseArray(data, 0, 4) (Code Fragment 5.7) on array data = {4, 3, 6, 2, 5}.
## Question #3: (Programming) - Lecture 10
Using linked-list Stacks, write a JAVA program that allows the user to enter a mathematical expression to check its validation. Implement the Parenthesis Matching Algorithm discussed in the lectures using linked-list Stack to be able to check whether a userâ€˜s mathematical expression is valid.

You can use the Stack code listed under the Course meterials to start your implementation.

You might need to make some adjustments to the code, add the paranthesisMatching method and test it in the Tester class. 

For example: (3 * 21 + 5) is valid, while (4 + 52 * [ 3 + 2 ] } is not valid.

## Question #4: - Lectures 10 & 11
#### A. Illustrate the current state of the Stack after each of the following stack operation:

push(5), push(3), pop( ), push(2), push(8), pop( ), pop( ), push(9), push(1), pop( ), push(7), push(6), pop( ), pop( ), push(4), pop( ), pop( ).

#### B. Illustrate the current state of the Queue after each of the following queue operation:

enqueue(5), enqueue(3), dequeue( ), enqueue(2), enqueue(8), dequeue( ), dequeue( ), enqueue(9), enqueue(1), dequeue(),enqueue(7), enqueue(6), dequeue( ), dequeue( ), enqueue(4), dequeue( ), dequeue( ).
